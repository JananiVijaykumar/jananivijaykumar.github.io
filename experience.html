      <h3>ClearBrain Inc., <br> May 2019 - August 2019</h3>
      <p class=exp-description>
       <strong>Position:</strong> Software Engineering Intern <br> 
        <strong>Location:</strong> San Francisco, CA<br> 
        <br> 
        ClearBrain is an Artificial Intelligence focused, growth marketing startup, that provides self-serve predictive analytics for growth marketers and product managers. This past summer I had the privilege of interning at ClearBrain for three whole months, where not only did I witness the launch of their patented Casual Analytics, but got to dive into all parts of their tech stack. <br> 
        <br> At ClearBrain, I had the opportunity to work on their frontend, implementing parts of their side navigation tool, learning new technologies such as React and node.js. I also worked on the backend of some new real-time frontend features, design Firebase functions to query BigQuery tables populated to real-time data, implementing the functionality to power two new graphs for the customers in the product's UI. I then spent the last month of my internship designing and implementing a table to store data from a specific run of a customer's pipeline, specifically to analyze the speed of the pipelines and the effects of any attempts to speed up the prediction pipelines for large customer data. Then using my newly created tables, I worked on trying out different methods of feature selection such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and sampling datasets in attempts of speeding up the pipelines and achieved a ~40% speedup for some of the longer pipelines! With an amazing team and lots of interesting project, this past summer was definitely one for the books.

      <h3>Armorblox Inc.<br> May 2018 - August 2018</h3>
      <p class=exp-description>
        <strong>Position:</strong> Machine Learning Intern <br> 
        <strong>Location:</strong> Sunnyvale, CA<br> 
        <br> 
        Armorblox is a cybersecurity company that uses deep learning and natural language understanding to protect enterprise communications and keep companies safe from phishing and other cybersecurity threats. <br> 
        <br> Armorblox will always have a special place in my heart because it was my very first internship experience and really gave me a taste of what it meant to work in industry. Throughout the summer, I got to work on cool projects such processing public slack messages to extract data to populate test emails that could be used to create datasets for testing, and worked on adding, cleaning, integrating these new datasets. I also had the unique opportunity to explore Natural Language Processing in the security space, and built topic modeling, content classification, using packages such as nltk, spacy, rake, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, and sklearn. I concluded my internship by validating bleeding edge Natural Language Understanding research on the new datasets I created. It was my work at Armorblox that truly solidified my decision to continue learning about Data Science and Machine Learning, to the point of purusing Data Science as my second major.

      <h3>Data Science Society at Berkeley<br>August 2018 - Present</h3>
      <p class=exp-description>
        <strong>Position:</strong> Academic Development Committee (Previous); <br>Senior Advisor (Current) <br> 
        <strong>Location:</strong> Berkeley, CA<br> 
        <br> 
        Data Science Society at Berkeley is UC Berkeley's first student organization centered on data science and its interdisciplinary applications. The society focuses on teaching educational workshops, hosting professional events, and consulting for top tech companies, with a goal of building an inclusive and accessible data science community at Cal for students of all levels and backgrounds.<br> 
        <br> As a member of the academic devlopment committee, I had the opportunity to teach multiple workshops in many different important Data Science topics and languages, ranging from languages such as Python and Pandas, SQL, and R, to larger topics like Statistics, Machine Learning, and Data Science in the context of business. Through teaching workshops for various groups of students such as the general student body, MBA students at the Haas School of Business, and even at a Bay Area Data Science Summit for students all over the area, I developed skills to better communicate with all types of people and learners, and solidified my own knowledge in the many disciplines I had the opportunity to teach others.
