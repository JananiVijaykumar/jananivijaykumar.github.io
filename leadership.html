            My amazing dance team, Natya at Berkeley, had the honor of winning first place last year at a traveling competition, called Laasya, the premier Indian classical dance competition in the nation. The ultimate prize of winning this prestigious compeition is having the opportunity to host it at your university the following year. So Natya at Berkeley and Laasya Board are super excited to be hosting Laasya 2020 in San Francisco, CA on March 12, 2020, in the Marine's Memorial Theatre! <br>

            <br>

            As a senior on my dance team this year, I have a priviledge of serving as the Director of this reputable dance competition, leading a board of 19 members and planning an unforgettable weekend for 8 lucky teams from around the nation. My responsibilities include coordinating lodging, food, and transportation for over 100 dancers during the weekend of the show, planning a mixer for the teams to mingle and have a little fun playing games before an intense competition, and ensure that all teams walk aways with memories to last a lifetime after a wonderful weekend in the Bay Area! As Director of the competition, I am developing better communication skills, to convey my vision, delegate tasks in an effective manner and ensure that these tasks get done. I am also gaining time management skills by trying to do my best to maintain a balance of a full academic course load, planning this competition, being a dancer on my dance team, serving as a peer advisor for UC Berkeley's Division of Data Science, and actively searching for my dream job. I will cherish these invaluable life skills that I am gaining as a leader, and will continue trying to grow to be the best version of me possible.
